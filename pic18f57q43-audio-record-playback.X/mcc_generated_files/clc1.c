   @Summary
     This is the generated driver implementation file for the CLC1 driver using PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs
 
   @Description
     This source file provides implementations for driver APIs for CLC1.
     Generation Information :
         Product Revision  :  PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs - 1.79.0
         Device            :  PIC18F57Q43
         Driver Version    :  1.0.0
     The generated drivers are tested against the following:
         Compiler          :  XC8 2.10 and above or later
         MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 5.30
